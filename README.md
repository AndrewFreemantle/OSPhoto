### About

This project aims to be a simple, private (and privacy-focussed) photo album that is compatible with Synology's DS photo [mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsphoto) [apps](https://itunes.apple.com/app/ds-photo/id321493106) and [desktop apps](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/dsm/6.2/software_spec/photo_station#affiliated_utility__photo_station_uploader) for browsing and uploads, with a future aim of a simple web interface too.

It works as a simple interface (or API) over your existing curated folders of photos and videos.

### Installation

Installation is a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/andrewfreemantle/os-photo) running on a Network Attached Storage server:

```shell
docker run \
  -d \
  --name='os-photo' \
  --net='bridge' \
  -e 'USERS'='SomeUser=TheirPassword;SomeOtherUser=AndTheirPassword' \
  -p '5000:5000/tcp' \
  -v '/path/to/a/photo-collection/':'/Media':'rw' \
  -v '/path/to/some/persistent/location/for/os-photos/metadata':'/AppData':'rw' \
  'andrewfreemantle/os-photo'
```

Once running, OSPhoto will accept http connections on port `5000` using any of the credentials specified in `"USERS"`.

### Configuration options

OSPhoto's configuration options can be altered by environment variables. These can be added to the `docker run` command with `-e`:
```shell
  -e 'ALLOW_COMMENTS`='true' \
```

### Rationale

There are a few reasons for this project, the main one being that Synology's PhotoStation has been superseded by a [Photos](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/dsm/feature/photos) application, which requires a version of their Disk Station Manager (DSM) which some older Synology hardware doesn't support.

### Progress

- [x] Initial project creation
- [x] Basic DS photo app support (login, browse) - [API ref](https://github.com/jamesbo13/syno-photostation-api)

- [x] Import descriptions, titles and metadata from Synology's PhotoStation
- [x] [HEIC/HEIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format) photo file support
- [x] Photo uploads, move and delete (via apps)
- [x] Album management (via apps)
- [x] Video uploads, thumbnails, preview/play, edit (title & description), move and delete (via apps)
- [x] Comments (importable from Photo Station)
- [ ] Tags (importable from Photo Station)
- [ ] Basic web browser interface: folders as albums, navigation, etc
